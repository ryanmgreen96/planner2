So, were forgetting the calendar idea, and going to a striclty piece meal module system. My work shecule will have its own setup, as will all other things, no overlap.
Considering this. At the top of the screen, titles stacked next to one another, these togule the particular moduels. It wil be work, light, and food. Those are the titles, were only working on work right now.
Simply, I get a work shecule every week, that shows me what shifts I have the week or so in advance -i get this thorugh a work browser. I need an easy way to input these, into this system, and by that count, store old shifts. For I need to know how many hours I've worked in prior pay periods, in total for the month, and just in general the history of pay. 
I am not usre our capability to have something akin to a calendar, where I can see the hours I worked, put in new hours, and also show pay periods and pay days. Can this calendar be made via online, as to see what the dates are, and just make a calendar from that. I also need to be able to tabulate my pay, based on the hours I work. I get payed 16.9 per hour, and so, per week, pay period and month, I need such tabulationos.
Clarify what you need to, and what I've asked about, then we can solidify the display of everything. We will be making a new file for this. Indeed, call it index. Question, would it be easier for you, and by that count use less AI/ git resources --as to not accumulate my limited usage-- if the file was massive, or if we had unique files per moduel, and they all connected to the index? Also, we are going to connect/store everything through firebase. I'll give you the sdk info when we procced

What I'm thinking, is that in the fullest view, I need to see 2 pay periods at once, basically, two sections of 7 on 7 blocks. Lets try 7 blocks ontop, running across, 7 underneath, this is a pay period, then the same thing beneath = 2 duos of 7 day weeks. Then, at the very bottom, I can see tabulations of pay period 1, 2, total.
Just normal black and white font/background.
